      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user authentication implementation into separate subtasks covering backend setup (Supabase project and auth configuration), database schema creation, frontend navigation structure, individual screen components, state management integration, and testing/validation workflows.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple technology integrations (Supabase, React Navigation, Zustand), security considerations, and cross-platform authentication flows. Critical foundation task requiring careful implementation."

      "taskTitle": "Slice 2: Implement Home Feed and Post Creation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the post creation and feed functionality into subtasks for database schema design, storage bucket configuration, feed UI components, post creation interface with media handling, and data flow integration between frontend and backend.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving file uploads, database operations, UI components, and media handling. Core feature with multiple technical components that need coordination."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the profile and follow system into subtasks for database relationship modeling, profile display components, profile editing functionality, and follow/unfollow mechanics with real-time count updates.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity with social networking features, database relationships, and UI components. Involves user interactions and data relationships but less complex than authentication."

      "taskTitle": "Slice 4: Implement Post Interactions (Likes & Comments)",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down post interactions into subtasks for database schema creation, like functionality with optimistic UI updates, comment system implementation, and integration with existing post components.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity focusing on user engagement features. Requires optimistic UI updates, database operations, and component integration but builds on existing foundation."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the chat system into subtasks for real-time database setup, chat list interface, individual chat screen, message sending/receiving logic, and real-time subscription management using Supabase Realtime.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to real-time functionality, WebSocket connections, message ordering, and state synchronization. Real-time features add significant technical complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the polish phase into subtasks for push notification setup and triggers, offline caching implementation, internationalization setup, RTL support, performance optimization, and cross-cutting concern integration.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple disparate systems (notifications, caching, i18n) each requiring different technical approaches. Cross-cutting concerns affect entire application architecture."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize production preparation into subtasks for error handling implementation, crash reporting setup, build configuration and signing, comprehensive testing procedures, and legal/compliance requirements (privacy policy, terms of service).",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity focused on deployment and quality assurance. While important, these are more procedural tasks with established patterns, though comprehensive testing can be time-consuming."
